# Shrine Foundations #

This folder holds my earliest projects, experiments, and code fragments.

Some of it is messy.
Some of it is broken.
All of it is mine.

These are the first bricks of the temple.

Nothing here is optimized â€” it's where I started before I knew how to stand.

Let it be ugly. Let it be sacred.
