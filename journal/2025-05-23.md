# 🗓️ May 23, 2025 — Slowed, But Not Stopped

After a couple of quiet days — one spent out, another lacking motivation — I got back to it today.

## 📘 Foundations First

I continued building up my core Python skills by finishing **Chapter 2** of *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*.

Covered:
- Boolean logic
- Comparison operators
- `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Loops and control flow

I answered all the review questions — most of them correctly — and finally clarified the way `range()` excludes its stop value.

## 🧪 Potion Mixer 3000: Still on My Mind

I revisited `potion-mixer-3000.py` today — the chaotic script I built early on to experiment with user input, branching, and basic logic.

I didn’t make progress on it — not because it’s broken, but because I see how much better I could structure it now. I started thinking about `Potion Mixer 4000`, a possible rebuild or extension — but didn’t jump into it yet.

## 🛠️ Plan Moving Forward

Rather than pushing ahead half-ready, I’ll continue the book and finish **Chapter 3 (Functions)** first. Once I have a stronger grasp on how to write modular, clean code, I’ll return to the potion project and evolve it with intention — not just intuition.

## 🧭 Reminder to Self

This isn’t about pushing code every day.  
It’s about building real fluency.  
The point was never the potion game — the point is:

- Becoming fluent in code  
- Understanding systems like blockchain and Web3 
- Becoming less reliant on GPT, and more structurally sound

> No guilt over the slow days. I’m still here — and still building.
