# 🗓️ May 19, 2025 — Block V2, Real Work Begins

Today I built and understood a full blockchain simulation with:

- A `Block` class (`index`, `data`, `timestamp`, `previous_hash`, `nonce`, `hash`)
- A `Blockchain` class (chain creation, dynamic block addition, validation)
- Proof-of-work using brute-force hashing until a hash starts with leading zeros (`00`)

---

## ✅ What I Learned

- `difficulty` controls how many zeros the hash must start with — more = slower
- `nonce` is the counter used to tweak the hash input until the condition is met
- `mine_block()` is the actual implementation of Proof-of-Work
- Blocks link by storing the `previous_hash`
- Chain breaks if a single byte of any block is tampered
- Bug I hit: I used `self.difficulty` before defining it — and now I know why that fails (Python runs top-down)

## 🔧 What’s Missing

Even though I understand what’s going on logically, I still need to **learn Python syntax deeply**:
- What `self` actually is
- How `__init__` works and how objects hold their state
- Scoping, method calling, and object memory

So I’m pausing heavy features for now and going **back to Python basics**. No fluff, just clear foundations.

## 🧮 Math Log

Started rebuilding math foundations too.  
Very basic level: solved ~15 beginner algebra equations.

I’m re-learning everything from scratch — like I’ve never seen a number before.

## 🎯 Moving Forward

I now know what I’m building.  
I now know where I’m weak.  
So I’m going in, clean.

> Study what I must.  
> Move forward anyway.
