# 🗓️ May 27, 2025 — Loops, Logic, and Letting Go

Today I tackled the **Collatz sequence** — a deceptively simple challenge that pushed me more than I expected.

At first, I misunderstood the loop logic. I had the print statements inside the `if` blocks, but never actually updated the variable controlling the loop. So the function ran once… and just stopped. I stared at it, confused why it didn’t do what I expected.

In hindsight, the mistake was obvious. But in the moment? It was a wall.

Eventually, I looked up an example to compare with mine. Part of me felt like I cheated — but honestly, it was the bridge between confusion and clarity. I worked backward from the correct structure, step by step, and adjusted my approach until it clicked.

## ✅ What I Built

- Refactored the sequence into a clean loop
- Added a **step counter** to track iterations
- Reused `promptYesNo()` from Potion Mixer 4000 for repeat runs
- Actually understood how and *when* to use `return` — not just what it does, but didn't end up using it in the end

## 🤯 What I Learned

- Updating your loop variable is… non-optional.
- Return placement changes everything.
- Looking up solutions is fine — if you treat them as learning material, not shortcuts.
- Visualization matters. If I can’t *see* what each line does, it’s probably going to break.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

I’m still slow. Still clumsy.

But I’m not pretending. I’m not copying. I’m building something real — not just code, but *intuition*.

> It’s not about writing flawless scripts.  
> It’s about learning how to fix what breaks — and *why* it broke.

And I did that today.
