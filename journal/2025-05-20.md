# 🗓️ May 20, 2025 — First Line by Hand, Second Script Forged

Today I finally started learning Python from the ground up.

- I read the first chapter of a beginner’s Python book (*Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*)
- More importantly, I **wrote my first full program completely by hand**
- No scaffolding, no copying — just raw typing, logic, and testing

The result was `potion-mixer-3000.py`, a chaotic and funny little script full of print statements, randomness, and beginner logic. Imperfect, but mine. It now lives in `shrine-foundations/` as the first fully self-written artifact.

## 🧠 On the Blockchain Front

No direct progress on blockchain logic today — and that’s intentional.

I’ve decided to **slow down blockchain development** for now to focus on deepening my Python fundamentals. The chain will continue, but I want to build it with understanding — not just execution.

That said:
- I’ll still explore blockchain code with GPT's help
- The goal is to **learn why it works**, not just run what works
- I’ll return with stronger logic and more autonomy

## 🛠️ Ritual Automation: My Second Script

While `newproject.ps1` was my first, today I wrote and set up my second custom PowerShell tool:  
`newjournal.ps1`.

It:
- Auto-creates a journal file in `temple-builds/journal` using today’s date
- Opens it directly in VS Code
- Is now globally aliased, so I can just run `newjournal` from anywhere

This is more than convenience — it’s the start of my **developer ritual system**.  
I’m no longer just coding — I’m designing the environment I build in.

## 🔁 Going Forward

This isn’t stepping back — it’s zooming in with intent.

- I’m laying down real syntax knowledge  
- Crafting tools I’ll actually use  
- And slowly turning rituals into systems

> The shrine has its first sacred script.  
> The chain will wait — but it knows I’ll return.  
> The forge is warm, and the tools are becoming mine.
