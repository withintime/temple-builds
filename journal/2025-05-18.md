## 🧪 From Hashing to Blocks

Yesterday’s file — `blockchain.py` — was just a fingerprint test:  
A basic SHA-256 hash on strings, just to understand how data mutates the result.  
Cool, but surface-level.

Today?  
**I actually built a block.**  
The real deal — `block-v1.py`.

- Built a `Block` class with `index`, `timestamp`, `data`, `previous_hash`, and the computed `hash`.
- Wrote a function to check chain integrity.
- Proved it was valid, then tampered with the data — and watched it break.

This was the first time the logic actually felt real.

## 🧨 Git War: 20 Minutes in the Void

After finishing `block-v1.py`, I pushed it — but didn’t know it.

Git wasn’t tracking it in `git status`.  
Why?  
Because I had **already pushed it** earlier, along with `.gitignore`, without realizing.

Then I used `--force` and **purged the entire repo** by accident.

I spent **20 minutes fighting ghosts**, thinking the file never made it.  
Renamed it to `block-v1-gitisweird.py` just to get Git to see it.  
Pushed it.

Then refreshed the GitHub repo.

💥 **Realization hit**:  
I *had* pushed `block-v1.py` earlier.  
That force push nuked the rest — the projects, journal, README, everything.  
I wiped it without knowing.

## 🔁 Rebuild and Reconcile

So I rebuilt the repo manually.  
Re-added structure.  
Pulled the current remote to merge the few recovered files.  
Pushed everything with intent.

Now I’ve got:
- `block-v1.py` (the real one)
- `block-v1-gitisweird.py` (a burned offering)
- The scars of the purge, stored visibly in the commit history

Didn’t delete the weird file.  
Didn’t delete the shame.  
Because the repo now tells the truth, not just the code.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Just because `git status` is silent doesn’t mean your push failed
- `--force` **means wipeout** — always pull first
- Git won’t stop you from doing irreversible things
- If you rename a ghost, it might come back
- The block you write teaches less than the block you break

## 🔖 Final Thought

 
This repo is a **timeline** — and it includes failure, illusion, recovery, and clarity.

The chain is now honest.  
And I won’t forget how I broke it just to understand what it was really made of.
