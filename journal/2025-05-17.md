# May 17, 2025 — First Hash, First Structure

Still sick, but I moved anyway.

Started the `blockchain.py` project — spun up using my custom `newproject` script.

## What I did:

- Ran my first hash function using SHA-256 in Python.
- Hashed the string `"blockchain"` and then `"this is my genesis block"`.
- Saw how small changes create totally different hashes — the fingerprint principle.

   ```python
  Hash of 'blockchain': ef7797e13d3a75526946a3bcf00daec9fc9c9c4d51ddc7cc5df888f74dd434d1
  Hash of the genesis block: 3d55e5e4ff7706c03a13eb6555216dc06245374a49971e8babe86de1f114c0ed

Then I updated the script.

## What I changed:

- Removed the default hashing code from my `newproject` script.
- Now it just creates a clean Python file with:
  ```python
  # $projectName.py
  # Auto-generated starter file
