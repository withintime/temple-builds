# 🗓️ July 7, 2025 — System in Mind, Flow on Paper

Today was all about architecture.  
Not code-first, but logic-first. I **designed a full flowchart** for the `jurner` project — outlining **how each part of the system should function** before writing it.

## 🧠 System Design: The Six-Part Flow

I structured the program around a clear, minimal interface:

[Main Menu]
[1] Start Journal
[2] Add or Change Category
[3] View Logs
[4] Settings
[5] Exit

Each of these options has a full, detailed logic tree:

### [5] Exit
- Checks whether a session log was created or altered
- If yes → exits clean
- If no → creates log and exits

### [4] Settings
- Placeholder for themes or other config options
- Logs any changes and returns to menu

### [3] View Logs
- Displays all logs in directory
- User can view contents and navigate back

### [2] Add / Choose Category
- Option to either add a new category or choose an existing one
- All choices are logged
- Selected category becomes default

### [1] Start Journal
- This is the heart:
  - Starts a timer and logs the start
  - Displays time, selected category, and journal options
  - If writing:
    - Creates a new file if it doesn’t exist
    - Or lets the user append with full context if it does
  - If stopping:
    - Ends session, calculates duration, logs it all

Even if the terminal is closed prematurely, the exit logic ensures recovery and logging.

## 💻 In Code Today

- ✅ Built a fully modular `main-menu.py`  
- ✅ Implemented `enumerate()`, tuple unpacking, and clean dispatch via `[(label, func)]`  
- ✅ Designed scalable menu logic, separating display from logic  
- ✅ Saw how different return types (index vs label) affect flow and architecture  
- ✅ Started thinking beyond the code — into system-level thinking

## 🪞 Reflections

What I noticed today isn’t just that I’m getting more fluent with Python —  
It’s that my brain is naturally leaning toward *system design*.  
Before writing code, I’m visualizing the state, the failure paths, the recovery logic, and user experience.

That’s not something separate from coding.
