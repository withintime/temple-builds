> Not a portfolio. Not a product.  
> This is a digital monastery for broken ideas and sovereign experiments.

Here I log my path as a total beginner exploring:
- Cryptography
- Web3 logic
- Decentralization
- Presence-based governance
- Autonomy systems (food, energy, information)

**No polish. No hype. Just process.**

This is where I:
- Break things to understand them
- Document what I learn
- Question everything
- Fail out loud

Every file is a fingerprint of presence.
